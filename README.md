E-commerce Data Analysis
Description
This repository contains data analysis materials for a Business Intelligence and Data Analytics project focused on e-commerce. The project includes:
• Presentation: A PDF file (`Presentazione-Data-Analyst.pdf`) that illustrates the workflow and the main insights obtained from the analysis of e-commerce data.
• Code: A file containing the code (SQL, Python, etc.) used for data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization.
Project Overview
The analysis is based on the public dataset `thelook_ecommerce` from Google BigQuery. The main activities include:
• Data extraction: Using SQL to query the database and obtain key metrics.
• Cleaning and transformation: Preparing the data for analysis.
• Predictive analysis: Applying machine learning models (linear regression and random forest) to segment users and predict behaviors.
• Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell the story of the data and support business decisions.
